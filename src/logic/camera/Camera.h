/**
 * @brief Camera class that manages the mapping World space to OpenGL Clip space via a sequence of
 * transformation matrices:
 *
 * clip_T_world = clip_T_camera * camera_T_world,
 *
 * where clip_T_camera is a projection transformation, either orthogonal or perpspective,
 * and camera_T_world is a rigid-body matrix, sometimes referred to as the View transformation that
 * maps World to Camera space. Its parts are
 *
 * camera_T_world = camera_T_anatomy * anatomy_T_start * start_T_world,
 * where:
 *
 *     i) start_T_world: User manipulations applied to the camera BEFORE the anatomical transformation.
 *
 *    ii) anatomy_T_start: Anatomical starting frame of reference that is linked to an external callback.
 *        This is where axial, coronal, sagittal, and crosshairs-Z/Y/X view orientations are set.
 *
 *    iii) camera_T_anatomy: User manipulations applied to the camera AFTER the anatomical transformation.
 *         This is used for manual user view manipulations (e.g. translation, rotation).
 *
 * Definitions of coordinate spaces:
 * Clip -- Standard OpenGL Clip space (normalized to [-1, 1]^3)
 * Camera -- Space of the view camera's intrinsic reference frame (in physical coordinates)
 * Anatomy -- Anatomical frame of reference of a subject (in physical coordinates)
 * Start -- Starting frame of reference (in physical coordinates)
 * World -- World space, common to all objects of the scene (in physical coordinates)
